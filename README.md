This package will help Python users use Google Drive API more easily. Its syntax is concise and understandable. It was developed based on [Google Drive API documentation](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/).

Thank you to the developer of [PyDrive2](https://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2). I used this package for the upload function and authorization with the local web server.
